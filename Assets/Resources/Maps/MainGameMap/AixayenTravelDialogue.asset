  - Aixayen, here we come!
  - Aixayen isn't really that big of a place. In the ancient days, it was probably
    just as minor as it is now.
  - Not much more than some farms, a town center, and this burial site we're going
    to.
  - It isn't much different from the other village burial sites, too. Only one level,
    since there was no nobility here, and very little is underground. It's mostly
    open air - at least, ever since the roof collapsed.
  - Here we are! Let me know when you're ready to head back to the settlement.
