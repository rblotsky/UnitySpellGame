  - Heading to the Lexai site, I see.
  - Lexai is a real old city, you know. The burial site here is actually the oldest
    one we've found!
  - Back when I was with another nomad group, we set up camp here for a few days.
    Let me tell you, <i>never</i> set up camp in an ancient burial site.
  - Hah, you're probably getting bored already. Well, here we are! Hop back on whenever
    you're ready to go back.
