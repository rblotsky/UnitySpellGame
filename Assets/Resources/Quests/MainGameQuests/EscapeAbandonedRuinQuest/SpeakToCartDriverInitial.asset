  - Well, looks like we're stuck here.
  - I TOLD you those beasts didn't look friendly, didn't I?!
  - You just HAD to try fighting them, without any weapons, huh?!
  - AND now they've eaten the wheels of my cart. Just fantastic. I doubt there's
    any way to get the wheel pieces back aside from killing them, SOMEHOW.
  - Go figure something out, why don't you. I'm sure that temple's COMPLETELY SAFE
    and has EVERYTHING YOU NEED to kill the stupid things and get my wheels back.
