IMPORTANT: How these "Tracking Quests" Work

Because individual quest stages cannot be checked for completion (and adding that feature will overcomplicate the quest system),
this quest will use other quests to track its progress. Whenever a specific gemstone is brought to the merchant, the main quest will run a dialogue
which in turn runs a quest update on completion. This quest update will immediately complete the quest for that gemstone.

When all of these Tracking Quests are completed, speaking to the NPC will complete the main quest.
The Tracking Quests are (generally) single-transition, straight from Initial to Success.
