  - You're back! Finally!
  - Well, did you find the [Burial Tablet] over at that ruin?
  - No? Seriously, it wasn't there?
  - Not good.. not good at all. We need this tablet..
  - Okay, I'll cross that off the list. We've got 2 more ruins left to search. It
    HAS to be in one of those two.
  - Head to those ruins, and look for the [Burial Tablet]. The only way we can make
    any more progress in this expedition is with that tablet.
